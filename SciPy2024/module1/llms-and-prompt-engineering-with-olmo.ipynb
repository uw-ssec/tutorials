    "**prompt:** The prompt to generate text from.\n",

    "**max_tokens:** The maximum number of tokens to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**temperature:** A higher temperature produces more creative and diverse output, while a lower temperature produces more deterministic output. In practical terms, you should use a lower temperature value for tasks like fact-based QA to encourage more factual and concise responses. For creative tasks, it might be beneficial to increase the temperature value.\n",

    "**top_p:** This parameter, in conjunction with temperature, offers a powerful tool for controlling the model's output. Known as nucleus sampling, it allows you to determine the level of determinism in the responses. By using `top_p`, you can specify that only the tokens comprising the top_p probability mass are considered for responses. A low top_p value selects the most confident responses, while a higher value prompts the model to consider more possible words, leading to more diverse outputs. The general recommendation is to alter `temperature` or `top_p` but not both.\n",

    "**frequency_penalty:** The frequency penalty applies a penalty on the next token based on how many times that token has already appeared in the generated response and prompt. The higher the frequency penalty, the less likely a word will reappear. This setting reduces the repetition of words in the generated response by giving tokens that appear more a higher penalty.\n",
