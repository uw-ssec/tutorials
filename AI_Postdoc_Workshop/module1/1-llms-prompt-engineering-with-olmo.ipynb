For creative tasks, it might be beneficial to increase the temperature value.\n",

Known as nucleus sampling, it allows you to determine the level of determinism in the responses. By using `top_p`, you can specify that only the tokens comprising the top_p probability mass are considered for responses. A low top_p value selects the most confident responses, while a higher value prompts the model to consider more possible words, leading to more diverse outputs. The general recommendation is to alter `temperature` or `top_p` but not both.\n",
