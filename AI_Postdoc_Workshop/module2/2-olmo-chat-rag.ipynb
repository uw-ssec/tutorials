    "## What is Panel?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) is a part of the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) ecosystem, which is a set of tools that make it easier to work with large datasets and create interactive visualizations. This ecosystem consists of the following tools beyond Panel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) to quickly generate interactive plots from your data\n",
    "- [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) to help you make all of your data instantly visualizable\n",
    "- [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org/) to extend HoloViews for geographic data\n",
    "- [Datashader](https://datashader.org/) for rendering even the largest datasets\n",
    "- [Lumen](https://lumen.holoviz.org/) to build data-driven dashboards from a simple YAML specification\n",
    "- [Param](https://param.holoviz.org/) to create declarative user-configurable objects\n",
    "- [Colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/) for perceptually uniform colormaps\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about this ecosystem is that all of these tools are designed to work together as part of the [Pandata scalable open-source analysis stack](https://github.com/panstacks/pandata?tab=readme-ov-file), so you can easily integrate them as needed.\n",
