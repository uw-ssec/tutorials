# Tutorials

This is the repository for a Jupyter Book website with tutorial materials for
the University of Washington Scientific Software Engineering Center (UW-SSEC).
The tutorials are written in Jupyter notebooks and are organized by topic or
workshop.

The website is hosted at
[https://uw-ssec-tutorials.readthedocs.io](https://uw-ssec-tutorials.readthedocs.io).

## GitHub Codespaces

This tutorial is available to run within
[Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - "a development
environment that's hosted in the cloud".

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. GitHub
currently gives every user
[120 vCPU hours per month for free](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts),
beyond that you must pay. **So be sure to explicitly stop or shut down your
codespace when you are done by going to this page
([https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)).**

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the tutorials, please feel free to open up
issues or pull requests, regarding current or future materials.
