```{include} ../timers/timer-15-minutes.md

```

## Room Setup (~2 minutes)

```{warning}
- Check Arielle's response to Anshul's email re: `We are planning to stick some of the larger easel sheets to the walls for display/voting, is this okay?`
- Decide dot color for each kind of vote.
- Resolve below comment with Sarah and rest of the team (2-3 max / don’t put a dot if you think it’s great / risks with any idea / AI safety? / AI skeptical?).
```

- Groups post their use case charts around the room.

## Voting and Feedback (~13 minutes)

- Participants walk around with voting dots.
- Place dots on (2-3 max / don’t put a dot if you think it’s great / risks with
  any idea / AI safety? / AI skeptical?):
  - Most innovative use case
  - Most practical/implementable
  - Most relevant to your field
  - Most surprising cross-disciplinary application
- Participants can add brief written feedback on sticky notes:
  - Focus can be on: "This reminds me of..." or "You could also..."
