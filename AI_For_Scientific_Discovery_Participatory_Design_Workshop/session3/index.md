# Session 3: Small Group Clustering

```{include} ../timers/timer-20-minutes.md

```

## Within Table Sharing & Idea Clustering (~15 minutes)

```{warning}
- Should facilitators join?
```

- Participants share their sticky notes with other members at their tables.
- Group and cluster similar problems together naturally.
- Look for patterns across disciplines and come up with themes.
- Goal is to organize and understand, but not to judge the idea.

## Sharing with Everybody (~5 minutes)

```{warning}
- Should facilitators do the sharing with everybody bit?
- Timing could be tight, confirm the concrete step here with rest of the team.
```

```{admonition} Prerequisites
- One of the facilitators opens up a Google Doc that is screen shared with the room for note taking. Share the link of the Google doc with everybody (through a QR code).
```

- Each table briefly shares its main problem clusters with the room and the note
  taker puts the notes in the Google doc.
- Other tables can add sticky notes if they have related ideas.
- People can look for surprising connections across other scientific fields.
