# Session 3: Small Group Idea Clustering

```{include} ../timers/timer-20-minutes.md

```

- Participants share their sticky notes with other members at their tables.
- Group and cluster similar problems together naturally.
- Look for patterns across disciplines and come up with themes.
- Goal is to organize and understand, but not to judge the idea.


```{admonition} Optional
- One of the facilitators opens up a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrO3m5CFdpZsWRVt4MdzBCzFh8BH99_hB1hZcHVm32E/edit?tab=t.0) that is screen shared with the room for note taking.
- Other tables can add sticky notes if they have related ideas.
- People can look for surprising connections across other scientific fields.
