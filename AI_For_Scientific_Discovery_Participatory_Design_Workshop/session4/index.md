# Session 4: Collaborative Use Case Development

```{include} ../timers/timer-20-minutes.md

```

```{admonition} Instructions
:class: attention

- Form Interest-Based Groups (Optional, ~5 minutes)

- Develop Use Cases

  - 1 Easel pad chart paper for 1 use case.
  - Groups work on easel chart paper, building ideas collaboratively.
  - Use Case Template:
    - **The Problem:** What specific research challenge does this address?
    - **The AI Solution:** What would the AI system do? (be specific)
    - **The Data:** What data would be needed to train/run this AI? What data
      would be needed to support the agentic AI?
    - **The Impact:** How would this change scientific practice?
    - **Cross-Field Applications:** How might this work or impact other
      disciplines?
```

```{admonition} Suggestions For Rich Use Case Development:
:class: caution

- Push for specificity and avoid vague "AI could help with data analysis or
  hypothesis generation".
- Consider feasibility at some point. Science fiction is great, but not all the
  use cases can be that. What would it take to actually build this?
- Think about adoption and encourage thinking around, would scientists actually
  use this?
- Explore unintended consequences and what could go wrong. How could it hurt
  scientific discovery?
```
