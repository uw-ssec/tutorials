# Session 4: Collaborative Use Case Development

```{include} ../timers/timer-25-minutes.md

```

## Form Interest-Based Groups (Optional, ~5 minutes)

- Participants can self-organize and move to different tables for the most
  compelling themes.
- Aim to maintain a decent headcount on each table.

## Develop Use Cases

- 1 Easel pad chart paper for 1 use case.
- Groups work on easel chart paper, building ideas collaboratively.
- Use Case Template:
  - **The Problem:** What specific research challenge does this address?
  - **The AI Solution:** What would the AI system do? (be specific)
  - **The Data:** What data would be needed to train/run this AI? What data
    would be needed to support the agentic AI?
  - **The Impact:** How would this change scientific practice?
  - **Cross-Field Applications:** How might this work or impact other
    disciplines?

### For Rich Use Case Development

- Push for specificity and avoid vague "AI could help with data analysis or
  hypothesis generation".
- Consider feasibility at some point. Science fiction is great, but not all the
  use cases can be that. What would it take to actually build this?
- Think about adoption and encourage thinking around, would scientists actually
  use this?
- Explore unintended consequences and what could go wrong. How could it hurt
  scientific discovery?
