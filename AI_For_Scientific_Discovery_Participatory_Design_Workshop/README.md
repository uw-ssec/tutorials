# AI to Support Scientific Discovery

## Workshop Summary

This participatory design workshop is motivated by the principle that AI for
scientific discovery can have an immense impact when solutions emerge from a
deeper understanding of research challenges and the scientific process, and are
scientist-centered rather than driven by technology-based assumptions about what
scientists need.

[Integrating AI-based models into scientific discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06221-2)
has been a significant area of interest to the scientific community, as
exemplified by recent
[scientific breakthroughs](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03214-7).
However, there are arguments that
[over-reliance on AI-driven modeling can be harmful](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01067-2)
to science. With the increasing adoption of generative models, discussions have
emerged on
[agentic AI for scientific discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08979) as a new
frontier for automating scientific research. Yet, there have also been
[concerns about the lack of scientific diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07727)
and how scientists may be misled
[by the hype surrounding AI for science.](https://www.understandingai.org/p/i-got-fooled-by-ai-for-science-hypeheres)

Through this workshop, we aim to gain insight into whether and how AI methods
can add value to the practice of various scientific disciplines. This includes
ways in which AI might accelerate and automate scientific discovery and other
specific aspects of the scientific process that are learned through experience
in their respective fields. By beginning with individual reflection on potential
scientific use cases for AI and moving through structured collaborative phases,
the participatory design approach will ensure that diverse scientific
perspectives are heard and synthesized. The protocol will strike a balance
between the need for systematic idea generation and interdisciplinary
discussions. It will accomplish this by using visual and tactile methods for
data collection that accommodate different thinking styles. This approach will:

1. Treat scientists as co-designers of AI solutions and applications.
2. Leverage their respective domain expertise.
3. Foster interdisciplinary dialogue and discussion that reveals unexpected
   applications.

The structured progression from individual problems to collaborative solutions
will ensure that the resulting use cases are scientifically grounded and will
identify opportunities for Generative AI to augment scientistsâ€™ current
practices that reflect the broader scientific community's needs.

Scientists who attend this workshop will develop practical knowledge about AI
applications in science, enabling them to better evaluate and advocate for AI
tools in their own research contexts. They will also leave with concrete AI use
cases directly relevant to their work, developed collaboratively and prioritized
by the broader scientific community. They will further contribute to shaping the
future of AI in science by ensuring that authentic scientific needs drive
technological development.

**Duration:** 90 minutes **Participants:** Scientists from multiple disciplines.
**Goal:** Develop practical knowledge about AI applications in science, and
collaboratively identify and develop Generative AI use cases across scientific
fields.
