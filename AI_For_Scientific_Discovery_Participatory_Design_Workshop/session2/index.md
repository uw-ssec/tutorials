```{include} ../timers/timer-15-minutes.md

```

```{admonition} Prerequisites
- Each participant has a print out with overlapping content from Session 1 for anchoring the rest of the workshop.
- Each participant has sticky notes of 3 colors:
    - Yellow
    - Green
    - Red
- 1 Easel pad on each table.
```

```{admonition} Goal
:class: tip

- Come up with specific challenges in your research domain, where you think tools powered by generative AI (or agentic AI) could be useful.
- Aim for 4-6 ideas per person.
- Individual idea generation is encouraged, but talk to other participants (and us) if you are stalled. Additionally, please refer to the printed material.
```

```{admonition} Optional Instructions
:class: attention

- Use <span style="background-color:green;color:white;">green sticky
  notes</span> for: `Existing AI-Powered Ideas.` For example, solutions you have
  heard about.
- Use <span style="background-color:yellow;">yellow sticky notes</span> for:
  `Problems Within Your Research Context.` For example, what frustrates you?
  Where could you appreciate more support?
- Use <span style="background-color:red;color:white;">red sticky notes</span>
  for: `Concerns With Integrating AI.` For example, what would be some risks in
  integrating AI in the research workflow with respect to your field?
